1. It was created for developers, ux developers and designers.
	• Developers will find code examples.
	• UX developers can see how the user experience is going to be.
	• And designers can see how everything looks.

2. Also we don't want to forget any cool features so we document them.

3. Homepage
	• Just a catching page with some widgets and their corresponding code.

4. Superheroes
	• We need data for some of our widgets and services so we choose to use superheroes.
	• So throughout the site you're going to see a lot of superhero references.

5. Navigation
	• Our navigation is broken up into the key areas of the framework.
	• We also include a site search. Let's try it out now.

6. Widgets (Input)
	• Document structure
		- Top Left: Interactive Widget
		- Top Right: Interactive Markup
		- Middle: API Demo/Widget Options
		- Bottom: API Explanation
	• consistent api names
		- For example, kind:
		- Varies the look of the widget.
	•  Modals, Logos and Button Bar

7. Services (Notification)
	• Document structure
		- Top: Demo Area
		- Middle: Tips and Code Examples
		- Bottom: API Explanation
	• Services can be helper functions or functions that interact with display features.
	• For example the notification service.
	• Notifications need to be accessed through the controller.

8. Form Validation
	• Form validation is an important feature to the framework
	• We needed a place to show form validation and it's conventions.
	• Let's start by show the validation.
	• Now let's show the disabled convention.

9. Layouts
	• Layouts are prebuilt templates with dropzones for content.
	• When creating a page you specifiy the layout and the what content goes into a dropzone.
	• This provides a consistent look throughout the application and helps developers get get rolling quickly
	• We needed to name the layouts something so we choose bird names.
	• Examples

10. Examples
	• Sometimes we need to mock up examples for quick reference and testing this is where we do that.
	• Favorites and Widgets inside of form lables.

11. Help
	• The help is a work in progress.
	• Help is place that will consist of things like what is a controller, how do I create a page and what is routing?
	• As of now, we have one help page that covers routing.
