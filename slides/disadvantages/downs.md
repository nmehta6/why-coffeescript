##Disadvantages of CoffeeScript
- Transpiler so it cannot solve all problems of JavaScript
- There is no VM so it cannot make any run-time decisions
- It does not offer any type checking
- Some consider lack of named function a disadvantage
- It will be replaced by ES6 in the future
- There are competing ES6 to ES5 compilers out there that will improve
