##Conclusion

- Node.js, like any tool, is not always the right choice
- Not suitable for a system that does some intensive processing
- I/O bound apps can benefit from Node.js

Note:

- Use the write tool for the job

- Understand the costs of I/O

- Another awesome feature is streams. But that's a whole separate topic of its own.
