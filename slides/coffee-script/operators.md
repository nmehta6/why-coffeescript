##More operators for readability
- truthy check with equality
```
if(dateNight === true)
{
    combHair();
}
//vs.
combHair() if dateNight is on  
```
- With a comprehension over an array
```
//some for loop that i'd rather not write :)
vs.
sacrifices(goat) if fan.team in ['cubs']
```
- Inverse if
```
spendWeekend() unless bernie is alive
```
- Or if it is more readable
```
spendWeekend() if bernie isnt alive
```
- Chained comparisons
```
foundAnswerToEverything = 42 < answer < 43
```
