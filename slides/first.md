Note:
Hi, I am Nachiket Mehta.

- I am a frontend engineer at Mediafly.

- We use Node.js for automation with Gulp as well as with NW.js, formerly known as node-webkit.

- Lately we have started using Node as a backend to create apis.

- I would like to take this opportunity to talk about my learning of Node.js and how it can be a great tool to solve certain problems.
