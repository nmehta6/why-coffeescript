##CoffeeScript's alignment with the future of JavaScript
- ES6 is the upcoming spec
- Brings significant amount of changes
- CoffeeScript allows you to use these features now
- Converting CoffeeScript to ES6 code is trivial (in most cases)
- Browser support for ES6 is [sparse](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
- IE 9 and 10 are not going away any time soon
- Compiling down to ES5 is possible with [6to5](https://6to5.org), [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler), etc.
- ES6 spec will be finalized in June, 2015
